    <p>Researchers are calling for a fundamental overhaul of how AI handles memory and context.</p>
    <p>Their proposal: a Semantic Operating System that can store, update, and forget information over decades, functioning more like human memory than today's short-lived context windows.</p>
    <p>The authors trace the development of context engineering through four phases. In the 1990s, early context-aware systems forced people to translate intentions into rigid, machine-readable commands. These systems could only process structured inputs.</p>
    <p>That changed in 2020 with models like GPT-3. These systems began interpreting natural language and understanding implications instead of relying on explicit instructions. Context engineering shifted from sensor data to unstructured, human-style input. Conversations that once vanished now became semi-permanent memories.
